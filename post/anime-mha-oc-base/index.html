-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=mha-villain-oc-base---ryuji-wallpaper>Mha Villain Oc Base - Ryuji Wallpaper<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#mha-villain-oc-base---ryuji-wallpaper>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f9/e4/2c/f9e42c319973ced4facc17c7ea0c906d.png onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.rrWqw94kE8GdXsrGyLlHcQHaFA&pid=15.1"' alt="Mha Villain Oc Base - Ryuji Wallpaper"><p><em>Source: ryujiwallpaper.blogspot.com</em></p><blockquote><p>mha bnha hero sachiko takenaka.</p></blockquote><p>What is anime and why are people interested in it?
